As a member of the public
So I can return bikes I've hired
I want to dock my bike at the docking station


As a member of the public
So I can decide whether to use the docking station
I want to see a bike that has been docked

------------------------------------------------

To complete this challenge, you will need to:

 - Write a feature test for docking a bike at a docking station
 - Write a unit test for the method you need to add to DockingStation to make docking possible
 - Pass both tests
 - Use an instance variable with attr_reader to do a full test-implementation cycle for the second User Story above
